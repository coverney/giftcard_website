FEATURED: STEVE WHEELER
 


Steve Wheeler was an American abstract painter who in part founded the movement known as the “Indian Space Painters”. The movement began in the 1930’s by a small group of painters living in New York, Steve Wheeler, Robert Barrell and Peter Busa, were among it’s earliest members. Steve Wheeler would go on to be the group’s most famous member. Influenced by Native American art and spirituality, much of his work is totally abstract with puzzle-like compositions and wild animation. In many ways the Indian Space Painters may be considered the forerunners of Abstract Expressionism.

Featured: Brett Weston
 

Brett Weston was described  as the “child genius of American photography.”  He was the second of the four sons of photographer Edward Weston and Flora Chandler. Weston’s earliest images from the 1920s reflect his intuitive sophisticated sense of abstraction. He often flattened the plane, engaging in layered space, an artistic style more commonly seen among the Abstract Expressionists. Brett Weston was ranked one of the top ten photographers collected by American museums by the final decade of his life. His photographs are included in the collections of countless museums.

Featured J. D. Salinger
 

The Catcher in the Rye was originally intended for adults but is often read by adolescents for its themes of angst and alienation, and as a critique on superficiality in society. Salinger managed to capture the exact moment between childhood and maturity, the unique moment between both worlds. Told in a realism and colloquial prose that has yet to be matched…. “If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap,” Holden Caulfield said. “But I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.”  The Catcher in the Rye has been consistently listed as one of the best novels of the twentieth century, and is now considered a modern classic.
Description: VERY RARE TRUE FIRST EDITION!  Hardcover w/ First State Dust Jacket, First Edition / First Printing. Little, Brown and Co. 1951.  Meets Points of Issue: 1st Edition Stated on copyright page. Dust Jacket has Lotte Jacobi photography credit on back panel, and $3.00 price on Dust Jacket flap. Not a Book-of-the-Month Book Club edition! Loss to head and tail of Dust Jacket spine, and sun-fading to what remains of it. The front panel of the dust jacket has a closed tear to its upper left corner, but is very bright! There is wear to the edges and corners of the jacket, but it is overall in good condition. This is a first state jacket with slight cropping of Salinger’s head on its back panel! The gilt on the book’s spine has worn away, but besides that it has only minor shelf wear – slight bumping to the head and tail of the spine and very minor wear to the edges of the boards. There is foxing to the edge of the text block and slight offsetting from publisher’s glue darkening the interior front and back hinge – common to titles from this period. Besides these flaws, the interior of the book is clean and free of any writing or similar markings! Overall, the book is in very good condition! Binding sound!

Featured: Irving Penn
 

Irving Penn defined several generations of fashion through his unique approach to photography.  Penn is perhaps best known for his fashion photography beginning with his notable 1950s series of the Paris fashion collections. He came to define the new look for magazines. By placing models against plain backdrops, Penn removed the familiar indicators of space or scale and allowed fashion to stand alone as the subject of his images. Many fashion photographs point to changes in aesthetic sensibilities as well as to changes in fashion itself, and Penn’s routine use of minimal, flat backgrounds can be viewed as the introduction of the modern age of fashion photography. Penn, who was born in 1917 in New Jersey, worked in New York as a graphic artist in the 1930s, and spent a year painting in Mexico before starting work at Vogue magazine in the early 1940s. His photographs have been widely exhibited, included in major retrospective exhibitions, and are in the permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Irving Penn’s work can be defined by his unique sophistication shot with a soft natural light. He has also become known for his unusual arrangements, photographed with great detail and clarity. While his prints are always clean and clear, Penn’s subjects vary widely. Many of his photographs have now become important works within the modernist photography canon. His still life compositions are skillfully arranged assemblages of food or objects; at once spare and highly organized, the objects are raised to a graphic perfection, articulating the abstract interplay of line and volume.
Description: SIGNED by IRVING PENN on the Title page. Hard bound in dust jacket. Some minor wear to dust jacket, otherwise very good. A nice copy of a scarce signed photography monograph.

FEATURED: CHRISTO & JEAN-CLAUDE
 

Christo and Jeanne-Claude are a married couple who create environmental installation art. Their works include the wrapping of the Reichstag in Berlin and the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris, the 24-mile-long curtain called Running Fence in Marin and Sonoma counties in California, and most recently The Gates in New York City’s Central Park.
Although their work is visually impressive and often controversial as a result of its scale, the artists have repeatedly denied that their projects contain any deeper meaning than their immediate aesthetic. The purpose of their art, they contend, is simply to make the world a “more beautiful place” or to create new ways of seeing familiar landscapes. Art critic David Bourdon has described Christo’s wrappings as a “revelation through concealment.” To his critics Christo replies, “I am an artist, and I have to have courage … Do you know that I don’t have any artworks that exist? They all go away when they’re finished. Only the sketches are left, giving my works an almost legendary character. I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create things that will remain.”
The temporary large-scale environmental works (both urban and rural environments) have elements of painting, sculpture, architecture and urban planning. Once the work of art has been read for what it really is, then the process preceeding the completion is easily understood. Nobody discusses a painting before it has been painted. Our projects are discussed and argued about, pro and con, before they are realized. To understand our work one must realize what is inherent to each project However there is an important diffrence between our works of art and the usual architecture and urban planning, we are our own sponsors and we pay for our works of art with our own money, never accepting any grants nor sponsors.

Description: SIGNED “Christo and Jeanne-Claude” on the half titlepage. Paperback copy with text in German and English. The Umbrellas, Wrapped Reichstag, and the Wall all reproduced in photographs and sketches. 160 pages. Minor wear to wrappers, otherwise very good.

FEATURED: JOAN DIDION
 

Joan Didion  is best known for her literary journalism and memoirs. In her novels and essays, Didion explores the disintegration of American morals and cultural chaos; the overriding theme of her work is individual and social fragmentation.  Slouching Toward Bethlehem is a collection of her feelings about the counterculture of the 1960s. The New York Times referred to it as “a rich display of some of the best prose written today in this country.” It has gone on to achieve a kind of “cult” status. A rare and sought after Modern first edition.
Description: Hard bound in dust jacket. First printing of the first edition stated on the copyright page. A nice copy with only the most minor wear to dust jacket edges. RARE!

Featured: Paul Bowles
 

The Sheltering Sky is a 1949 novel of post-colonial alienation and existential despair by American writer and composer Paul Bowles. The story centers around Port Moresby and his wife Kit, a married couple originally from New York who travel to the North African desert accompanied by their friend Tunner. The journey, initially an attempt by Port and Kit to resolve their marital difficulties, is quickly fraught by the travelers’ ignorance of the dangers that surround them.  In his 1949 review for The New York Times, Tennessee Williams remarked, “With the hesitant exception of one or two war books by returned soldiers, The Sheltering Sky alone of the books that I have recently read by American authors appears to bear the spiritual imprint of recent history in the western world.”.
Description: TRUE FIRST EDITION. First printing of the first edition. Hard bound in dust jacket. Meets all points of issue including $2.75 price on dust jacket.  Some minor wear to page edges and boards, otherwise with interior clean and binding sound. The original Lustig designed dust jacket shows several tears, with spine edges and corners chipped. Now protected in clear removable mylar cover. The Sheltering Sky tells the story of an American couple who travel from New York to Northern Africa during the waning years of the colonial era. An instant critical and popular success, The Sheltering Sky established Bowles as an important American author. Rare and sought after!

Featured: Dennis Stock
 

Growing up in Upper Manhattan, close to Harlem, Dennis Stock was exposed to jazz at an early age. As a child, Stock would accompany his father to the famous Apollo Theatre in Harlem, where prominent jazz musicians of the time such as Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie would perform. These experiences would prove to be formative, sparking an interest that he would later return to as a photographer. In 1957, Stock embarked upon a journey inspired by those early memories that would culminate in one of his best-known bodies of work: ‘Jazz Street’.

FEATURED: LORETTA LUX
 

Loretta Lux is a fine art photographer known for her surreal portraits of young children. She was born in Dresden, East Germany and currently lives and works in Monaco. Stare at a Loretta Lux portrait long enough, and you’re bound to feel completely mesmerized. Lux does not strive to create faithful photographic representations of her young subjects. Instead, each image is painstakingly composed and manipulated to create psychically charged explorations of the nature of childhood. The consistently forlorn expressions of her models combined with the hyperreality of the image create portraits that transcend their subjects and remind us that childhood is as chaotic and multidimensional as any other part of life.
Description: SIGNED BY LORETTA LUX on the title page. INSCRIBED BY LUX TO THE PHOTOGRAPHER DAVID GAMBLE on page 5 “This book is for David Gamble 10th May 20054. East Hampton Please sign anything”. Hard bound, no dust jacket as issued. 45 color plates. Introductory essay by Francine Prose. Biographical notes, exhibition history. A selection of the surrealistic photographic portraits of children by Loretta Lux in which the subjects are posed and then digitally altered. Internally clean and unmarked with sound binding. A rare signed association copy.

FEATURED: WALKER EVANS
 

Walker Evans was one of the 20th century’s most influential photographers. For three years beginning in the winter 1938 he rode the Lexington Avenue Local along with the photographer Helen Levitt, Evans with his 35mm camera hidden between the buttons of his coat. He surreptitiously photographed the subway passengers in his quest to document the “real”. Evans had developed his unique style of photography while working for the Farm Security Administration, photographing the rural poor of the deep south. Like Dorothea Lang and Margaret Bourke White, Walker Evans created some of the most iconic images of the depression era. He attempted to show his subjects without their “mask on”, in the still moments of quiet introspection when their guard was left down. The photographs lay unpublished for 25 years. In 1966 ninety were chosen from over six hundred and paired with an essay written by James Agee in 1941. Evan’s body of work went on to inspire a generation of photographers. Each portrait captures a real person within a singular moment, as unique as a thumb print or a snowflake.
Description: First Edition. Hard bound in Dust jacket. Stated “First Printing R”on the copyright page. 178 pages. Published in association with the Riverside Press, Cambridge. Wear to dust jacket that shows several large chips and tears, now protected in clear removable Brodart cover. Introduction by James Agee.

Featured: Lars Tunbjörk
 

Lars Tunbjörk is one of Sweden’s most respected photographers. He was born in 1956 in Boras, on the western coast of Sweden. He is frequent contributor to leading international magazines and a member of the VU picture agency in Paris. Tunbjork is known for his unique vision of recreational and working environments. His more recent work is now devoted to the exploration of color, which he approaches in the style of 1970’s American photographers. This is his starting point for questioning the world, a series of interrogations more than observations, which he develops without pessimism but with an undeniable affliction softened by a biting humor. Over time, his approach has become radicalised and purified by being less and less anecdotal. Consequentially, his series no longer represents characters but rather the often absurd track of their presence and their actions. His work is among the permanent collection at MoMa and has been shown in museums and galleries throughout the world, including: The ICP, Museum of Modern Art: Stockholm, Museum of Photography: Tokyo, Hasselblad Center: Sweden, and The Akademie Der Kunste: Berlin.
Description: Hard bound, no dust jacket as issued. Published in conjunction with Goteborg’s Hasselblad Center. First edition stated. 49 color photographs of elegantly detached images of Swedish housing projects, yards and interiors devoid of their occupants. Text in English. Designed by Greger Ulf Nilson. With a bibliography and exhibition history. Very minor wear to dust jacket edges, otherwise very good. Interior clean and binding tight. A scarce first printing! After his earlier series on leisure time and the world of office labor, Lars Tunbjark returned to his childhood neighborhood to photograph his mother’s house. The experience intrigued him, and he continued shooting in similar areas around Sweden. Saturated with other people’s personal memories, his photographs convey the peculiar atmosphere of silence familiar in middle-class housing districts, not only in Sweden but in other countries as well. If on the surface his images purport to investigate the private domestic realm in terms of architecture, home decorating styles, and garden culture, as seen in Sweden during the latest two decades, under these multiple, quiet surfaces they reveal apocalyptically more. Home is the final book in a trilogy, following Country beside Itself and Office.

Featured: Irving Penn
 


Irving Penn defined several generations of fashion through his unique approach to photography.  Penn is perhaps best known for his fashion photography beginning with his notable 1950s series of the Paris fashion collections. He came to define the new look for magazines. By placing models against plain backdrops, Penn removed the familiar indicators of space or scale and allowed fashion to stand alone as the subject of his images. Many fashion photographs point to changes in aesthetic sensibilities as well as to changes in fashion itself, and Penn’s routine use of minimal, flat backgrounds can be viewed as the introduction of the modern age of fashion photography. Penn, who was born in 1917 in New Jersey, worked in New York as a graphic artist in the 1930s, and spent a year painting in Mexico before starting work at Vogue magazine in the early 1940s. His photographs have been widely exhibited, included in major retrospective exhibitions, and are in the permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Irving Penn’s work cn be defined by his unique sophistication shot with a soft natural light. He has also become known for his unusual arrangements, photographed with great detail and clarity. While his prints are always clean and clear, Penn’s subjects vary widely. Many of his photographs have now bwcome important works within the modernist photography canon. His still life compositions are skillfully arranged assemblages of food or objects; at once spare and highly organized, the objects are raised to a graphic perfection, articulating the abstract interplay of line and volume.
Description: Hard bound with dust jacket, missing original slipcase.183 pages. Introduction by Alexander Liberman. Romemary Blackmon collaborated in the writing of captions and text. First Edition of Penn’s first book. Eight essays in photographs and words by Irving Penn. A nice copy of a scarce photography monograph.
